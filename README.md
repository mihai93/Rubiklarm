# Rubiklarm
Solve a Rubik's cube to turn off the alarm! Uses OpenCV with blob detection, simply launch the app, point the camera at the solved sides of Rubik's cube until you get a green, in-focus square, repeat for each side until your alarm turns off.

Attempt to port Rubiklarm from Kit Kat to Marshmallow

## Problems
- OpenCV has issues running on Nexus 5 and/or Marshmallow
- Need to look at alternative libarries to OpenCV
